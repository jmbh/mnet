Changes in Version 0.1.4
  O Added function to compare N=1 (non-multilevel) VAR models
Changes in Version 0.1.3
  o In the permutation test, group differences in partial correlations between random intercepts (the "between-network") are now tested based on averaged regression coefficients instead of partial correlations based on averaged regression coefficients. This was changed such that the permutation test uses the same parameters as the parametric test. We use the regression coefficients for the latter, because we have standard errors for those.
Changes in Version 0.1.2
  o New argument "trueMeans" in mlVAR_GC() for developmental purposes
  o Made Student's t-test default for parametric test
  o Some tweaks to the parametric test
  o New example dataset by Koval et al. (2013)
  o Included permutation test for paired samples
Changes in Version 0.1.1
  o Fixed bug in input checks
  o Changed how groups are provided to the function mlVAR_GC; before with two separate arguments, now we specify a column name with the group variable to make it more consistent with the other arguments
  o Included empirical data of Fried et al. (2022)
  o Added a parametric test for fixed lagged, fixed contemporaneous, and between network parameters
